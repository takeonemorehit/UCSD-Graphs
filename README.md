MESSAGE FROM STUDENT:

Not all files in this project were written by me, the student. This project was assigned to me as part of an online Java programming course offered by UC San Diego. 
Some files in this project were authored by the UCSD MOOC Team: Mia Minnes, Christine Alvarado, Leo Porter, Alec Brickner, and Adam Setters. The files the team provided me are skeleton code, as well as grading previews and testing files to be used in completing the course programming assignments. 
The other files, and most of the code, I wrote myself.
